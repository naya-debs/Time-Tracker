# Time-Tracker
# Description
This program can be used to calculate the amount of money a person earns based on the number of hours worked in a day.
The system captures and retrieves the systems date and uses time inputs for start and finish times to calculate the number of hours worked


# Modules Used
1. The datetime module is an in-built function used in this program to capture the system's date and format the time inputs from the user: The line of code for importing is as shown below.
from datetime import datetime

2. The csv module is also an in-built function used in the append mode(mode ='a') for adding new records to the created csv file.

# Design Thinking Steps
1. Retrieve system date
2. Ask for start time and end time from user
3. Find the difference between the start and end dates â€“to find the hours worked
4. Multiply hours worked by amount (5 cedis).
5. Put records in a csv file

# Design Implementation
* The datetime.now() function is used to retrieve the system's date
* The user is allowed to enter the start and finished time
* The datetime.strptime() function formats the input times into the defined format--A time format in hours and minute is defined(time_format)
* The difference between the start and end time is calculated and rounded two figures to give us the hours spent
* The time difference is multiplied by $5 to obtain the total amount earned
* An empty list is created and the records appended to it.
* A csv file is created in the append mode(mode='a') and the data written to it for each entry
